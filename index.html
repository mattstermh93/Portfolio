    <p>I grew up in Boston with a dream of becoming an NBA player. In high school I realized that
	wasn't going to pan out, but I didn't know what the future was going to hold. Here I am at the
	age of 25 still trying to figure out what the future will hold, but at least I'm trying something
	different, and something I have a passion for. I have been working in
	technical support for three years; I started right after graduating from college.
	Although I enjoy my job, and I have gained some valuable skills, I don't find it challenging, rewarding,
	or meaningful. I want to utilize my creativity and see the direct results of my work, which I find
	in coding. Although I'm not good at coding, I'm willing to work on getting better.
	I can't say the same for other areas of study. My goal was to make this page mobile friendly,
	but I haven't had a chance to test that yet.</p>
